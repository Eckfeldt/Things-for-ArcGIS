#Python
#This code would seach a field called Comments and look for various substrings. The values "Weak", "Moderate", "High" are returned.

#the following goes into the field = 
myCalc(!Comments!)
#!Comments! is the actual field name

#The following goes in the pre-logic script
def myCalc(comment):
   if ('W' in comment):
      return 'Weak'
   elif ('Mod' in comment):
      return 'Moderate'
   elif ('Hig' in comment):
      return 'High'
   else:
      return "failure"
  #(comment) could be called anything. it is declaring whatever myCalc passes as a variable called comment
